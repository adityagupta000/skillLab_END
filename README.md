This project is a real-time hospital information management system focused on improving operational efficiency at Wenlock Hospital. It aims to integrate all critical departments into a single centralized platform.
Introduction 
Wenlock Hospital currently faces major bottlenecks due to fragmented departmental workflows, lack of real-time communication, and manual processes. Critical areas such as patient token management, operation theatre (OT) scheduling, pharmacy inventory, and emergency handling are siloed, resulting in delays and operational inefficiencies.

This project aims to digitally transform Wenlock Hospital with a centralized, real-time web-based system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and optional AI services. It facilitates seamless coordination between departments like Cardiology, Pharmacy, and OT, while improving patient satisfaction and internal resource utilization.
